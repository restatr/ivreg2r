\usage{
.compute_model_f(
  coefficients,
  vcov,
  N,
  K,
  has_intercept,
  vcov_type,
  small,
  M = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{coefficients}{Named numeric vector of coefficient estimates.}

\item{vcov}{Variance-covariance matrix of coefficients.}

\item{N}{Integer: number of observations.}

\item{K}{Integer: number of regressors (including intercept if present).}

\item{has_intercept}{Logical: does the model include an intercept?}

\item{vcov_type}{Character: \code{"iid"}, \code{"HC0"}, \code{"HC1"}, or \code{"CL"}.}

\item{small}{Logical: whether small-sample corrections were applied.}

\item{M}{Integer or NULL: number of clusters (only for \code{vcov_type = "CL"}).}
}
\value{
Named list with \code{model_f}, \code{model_f_p}, \code{model_f_df1},
\code{model_f_df2} (all \code{NA} when df1 = 0 or VCV is not positive definite).
}
\description{
Computes the Wald F-statistic for the joint null that all slope
coefficients equal zero. The intercept (if present) is excluded from
the test.
}
\note{
The model F-statistic is always reported as an F-distributed
statistic. For non-IID VCE types, the underlying Wald chi-squared is
converted to F using VCE-branch-specific degrees of freedom adjustments.
This matches Stata's \code{ivreg2} behavior.
