\title{Compute cluster scores (weight-type-agnostic)}
\usage{
.cl_scores(basis, resid, weights = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{basis}{N x K matrix.}

\item{resid}{N-vector of residuals.}

\item{weights}{Normalized weights or NULL.}
}
\value{
N x K score matrix.
}
\description{
Cluster scores are \code{weights * basis * resid} for all weight types.
The definition of \code{weights} (normalized for aweight/pweight, raw for fweight)
makes this expression correct for all types.
