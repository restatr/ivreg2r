\title{Compute HAC meat from pre-formed score vectors}
\usage{
.hac_scores_meat(scores, time_index, kernel, bw, weights = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{scores}{N x P score matrix, in sorted time order.}

\item{time_index}{List from \code{.build_time_index()}.}

\item{kernel}{Canonical kernel name.}

\item{bw}{Numeric bandwidth.}

\item{weights}{Normalized weights (sorted) or NULL. For the KP path,
weights are already incorporated into the scores.}
}
\value{
P x P symmetric meat matrix (unscaled).
}
\description{
Like \code{.hac_meat()} but takes pre-formed N x P scores directly, without
separate basis and residual vectors. Used by the Kleibergen-Paap path
where scores are Kronecker products that cannot be factored into
basis * resid form.
