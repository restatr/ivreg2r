\title{Compute HC meat matrix with weight-type dispatch}
\usage{
.hc_meat(basis, resid, weights = NULL, weight_type = "aweight")
}
\arguments{
\item{basis}{N x K matrix (X_hat for IV, X for OLS).}

\item{resid}{N-vector of residuals.}

\item{weights}{Normalized weights or NULL.}

\item{weight_type}{Character: \code{"aweight"}, \code{"fweight"}, or \code{"pweight"}.}
}
\value{
K x K symmetric meat matrix.
}
\description{
For aweight/pweight: meat = (w * X * e)' (w * X * e) = X' diag(w^2 e^2) X.
For fweight: meat = X' diag(w * e^2) X (linear in weights, not quadratic).
For unweighted: meat = X' diag(e^2) X.
