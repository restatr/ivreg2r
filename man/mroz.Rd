\description{
Cross-sectional data on 753 married white women from the Panel Study of
Income Dynamics (PSID), 1975. Of these, 428 were working (\code{inlf == 1})
with observed wages. Used by Mroz (1987) to study married women's labor
force participation and hours of work. A classic IV application instruments
education with parental education (\code{motheduc}, \code{fatheduc}).
